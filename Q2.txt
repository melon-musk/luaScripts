function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
-- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
local resultId = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))

if resultId then
    local guildName = result.getString(resultId,"name")
    repeat
            local task1 = result.getString(orderQuery, 'task')
            print(guildName)
        until not result.next(orderQuery)
        result.free(orderQuery)
    
    else print("No guilds found with memebers less than:",memeberCount)
end
end

--[[
Reasoning: 1) I added a if condition on resultID to check whether we do infact receive
		some entries from executing the query. This will allow us to take care of the negative case.
	2) From what I've found out result.getString() takes two parameters.
	3) We need to iterate through the results in a repeat until loop. A single print will only print 
	the first entry
