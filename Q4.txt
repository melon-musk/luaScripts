function do_sth_with_PlayerParty(playerId, membername)
local player = Player(playerId)
local party = player:getParty()
local members = party:getMembers()

for k,v in pairs(members) do
if v.name == membername then
party:removeMember(player)

--[[
Assumptions: 
i am assuming getMembers() is such a function that allows us to get memebers from the party
v.name or player.name is such a property on the members (which is of type player)

Reasoning:
1) player needs to be local to avoid any conflicts since earlier it was in a global scope.
2) I make a copy of the memebers since in the loop we're removing members from a part while still iterating over the same party	
which could lead to some unxpected behaviour
3) I break from the loop once i find the member i want to remove. Avoids unecessary iterations of the loop once found.
4) Since I already have a reference to the player in the star of the function i can use that in the function party:removeMember(player)
